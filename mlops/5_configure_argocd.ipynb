    "There are a couple of “complications” we need to manage as part of this deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic environment-specific customization**: as in [Cloud Computing on Chameleon](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/cloud-chi/), we want to specify the `externalIPs` on which our `ClusterIP` services should be available. However, we only know the IP address of the “head” node on the Internet-facing network after the infrastructure is deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Argo CD gets our service definitions from a Git repository, and we don’t want to modify the `externalIPs` in GitHub each time we deploy our services.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we deploy our services using Helm, a tool that automates the creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of Kubernetes applications. With Helm, we can include something like this in our Kubernetes manifest/Helm chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "      externalIPs:\n",
    "        - {{ .Values.minio.externalIP }}\n",
    "\n",
    "and then when we add the application to ArgoCD, we pass the value that should be filled in there:\n",
    "\n",
    "            --helm-set-string minio.externalIP={{ external_ip }} \n",
    "\n",
    "where Ansible finds out the value of `external_ip` for us in a separate task:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - name: Detect external IP starting with 10.56\n",
    "          set_fact:\n",
    "            external_ip: \"{{ ansible_all_ipv4_addresses | select('match', '^10\\\\.56\\\\..*') | list | first }}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This general pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   find out an environment-specific setting using Ansible\n",
    "-   use it to customize the Kubernetes deploymenet using Helm or ArgoCD + Helm\n",
    "\n",
    "can be applied to a wide variety of environment-specific configurations. It can also be used anything that shouldn’t be included in a Git repository. For example: if your deployment needs a secret application credential, you can store in a separate `.env` file that is available to your Ansible client (not in a Git repository), get Ansible to read it into a variable, and then use ArgoCD + Helm to substitute that secret where needed in your Kubernetes application definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment with secrets**: our deployment includes some services that require authentication, e.g. the MinIO object store. We don’t want to include passwords or other secrets in our Git repository, either! To address this, we will have Ansible generate a secret password and register it with Kubernetes (and print it, so we ourselves can access the MinIO dashboard!):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Generate MinIO secret key\n",
    "        when: minio_secret_check.rc != 0\n",
    "        set_fact:\n",
    "        minio_secret_key: \"{{ lookup('password', '/dev/null length=20 chars=ascii_letters,digits') }}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Create MinIO credentials secret\n",
    "        when: minio_secret_check.rc != 0\n",

    "        --from-literal=secretkey={{ minio_secret_key }}\n",
    "        register: minio_secret_create\n",
    "\n",
    "and then in our Kubernetes manifests, we can use this secret without explicitly specifying its value, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    env:\n",
    "    - name: MINIO_ROOT_USER\n",
    "        valueFrom:\n",
